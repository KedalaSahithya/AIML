Users\\' sentiment towards recipes is quantified on a 1 to 5 star rating scale, with a score of 0 denoting an absence of rating.\\n\\nThis dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and data scientists, facilitating endeavors in sentiment analysis, user behavior analysis, recipe recommendation systems, and more.
